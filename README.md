# DevArch - Continuous architecting
### Automated Software architecture diagram generation with handmade quality
___
DevArch provides an alternative method for creating architecture diagrams.

Following the footsteps of reverse-architecting, DevArch aims to provide one button press diagram generation.

However, instead of allowing the developer to later modify the generated diagrams to their liking (which can be extremely demanding), DevArch relies on smart filtering algorithms that allows the user to customize *how* the diagram is generated: What makes a class important enough to be displayed on this diagram? What is the scope and what do i want to communicate? etc.

These customizations, or rather, *diagram definitions*, can then be checked in together with the sourcecode. 

This means that anyone with the sourcecode are able to review the architecture and modify it without losing the original architects intent.
___
**DevArch makes diagram generation faster, easier and more formal.**
