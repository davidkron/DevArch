###Handmade quality diagrams

Reverse engineered diagrams are usually big and complex because they are not abstracted. By providing a framework (the diagram definition) in which one can specify and combine different filters, the diagrams become readable again.

Sounds too complicated? No problem, just stick with the defaults!
